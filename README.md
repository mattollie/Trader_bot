# Trader_bot
# This projects aims to create an algorithm that will make stock trades automatically.
# Currently the program runs as either a wallstreetbets reddit scraper, which takes the top 5 most mentioned stock tickers, or 5 stock tickers which you wish to retrieve analytics.
# Algorithm to perform analysis on information retrieved from alpha vantage yet to be implemented.
# Currently the program is setup to notify you via email, which stocks you should look at because they will theoretically be doing well or on the verge of a breakout.
# First step in algorithm is to find support and resistance lines via the moving averages retrieved via alpha vantage.
# Other technical analysis to be integrated -> RSI, Volume, Stochastic Oscillator, etc...
# Company statics should also be integrated in a seperate file i.e. income statement, cashflow, earnings calendar, etc. All can be retrieved via alpha vantage
# News articles should also be integrated in a seperate file and can be retrieved via alpha vantage.
# Economic indicators should also be integrated in a seperate file i.e. cpi, inflation, retail sales, inflation expectation, GDP, etc.
# The goal is to refine the algorithm so that a bot can make the trades automatically instead of relying on the human to make the ultimate decision.
